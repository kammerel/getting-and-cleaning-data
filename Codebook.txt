## Directories

* main_wd should be set to the main directory where all data is contained
* test_wd is the directory which points to the path where the test data is
* train_wd is the directory which points to the path where the train data is

## Test Set

* X_test is a table of the test set without names and only values
* features is a table of feature names which are used to give the measured features names therefore the second column is converted to character.
* y_test contains the acitivity ID. The column name is renamed to "activity"
* subject_test contains the personal identifiers of the participants. The column name is renamed to "ID"
* test is a data frame which summarizes the test set, the activity IDs and the participant's IDs

## Train Set

* "X_train" is a table of the train set without names and only values. The column names are set by the feature table which is described above
* "y_train" is a table which contains activity IDs. The colum name is renamed to "activity".
* "subject_train" contains the personal identifiers of the participants. The column name is renamed to "ID"
* "train" is a data frame which summarized the train set, the activity IDs and the participant's ID

## Merged Data

* "data" is a data frame which consists of the merged training set with the test set
  * It is subsetted to activity, ID and mean_names and std_means, which are described below
  * The activities in the "data" data frame are indexed using the "activity_labels" and thus named converted from IDs to written out labels
* "mean_names" is a character vector including all column names which contain the word mean
* "std_names" is a character vector including all column names which contain the word std (i.e. the standard deviation)
* avtivity_labels is a table containing activity labels that were observed

## Tidy Data

* "by_ID_act" has different classes, it is a grouped_df, a tbl_df and a data.frame. It is the "data" data frame grouped by ID and activity
* "res" is the "by_ID_act" summarized by the mean and is tidied by the following actions within the column names:

  * "-" is replaced by a "."
  * the abbreviation "t" is replaced by "time"
  * the abbreviation "f" is replaced by "frequency"
  * parenthesis are removed
  * commas are replaced by dots

* Further cleaning was not consideres as the column names would have been to long if all parts were written out

* A further split of the column names is not recommended as too many NAs would be introduced
